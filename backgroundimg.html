    <center><h1>The Haunted Tree</h1></center>
    <p>

In the small village of Nandipur, where the mist rolled over the hills like slow-moving ghosts, stood a tree unlike any other. Towering and gnarled, it grew alone at the edge of the village near the old abandoned well. The villagers called it *“The Whispering Tree.”*

No one remembered when the tree first sprouted. The oldest records had no mention of it, yet it was always *there*—looming, silent during the day, but at night… it whispered.

Children dared each other to approach it after dark. Some returned pale and shaking, others never spoke of it again. The whispers, they said, weren’t just the wind. They were voices—urgent, pleading, sometimes laughing with a hollow echo that stayed in your bones.

Ravi, a skeptical young man from the city, returned to Nandipur to visit his aging grandmother. He laughed at the villagers' stories. “A haunted tree? Really?” he’d say with a smirk.

One foggy night, driven by curiosity and disbelief, Ravi went to the tree with only a flashlight and a recorder. “Let’s see what these whispers are,” he muttered.

The air was unnaturally cold. His flashlight flickered as he approached. He leaned in and pressed ‘record.’

Nothing. Just silence.

Then—

**“Ravi…”**

He spun around. No one. The voice had come from the tree.

**“We see you…”**

He stumbled back. The bark twisted subtly like it was breathing. His recorder crackled.

**“Come closer…”**

Drawn by something he couldn’t explain, he reached out and touched the bark.

His mind filled with visions—of a woman being buried beneath the tree long ago, betrayed by her own kin. Her spirit bound to the roots, feeding on the fear of those who dared listen.

Ravi screamed, pulling his hand back, but it was too late. The tree had marked him.

The next morning, the villagers found the recorder beneath the tree. It played one final whisper:

**“Now, he whispers too.”**

Ravi was never seen again.

But some nights, when the wind is still and the moon is high, the tree speaks in two voices.

And the villagers walk a little faster past the edge of the village… never looking back.

    **Continuation of *The Whispering Tree***
*Part 2: The Roots Run Deep*

After Ravi’s disappearance, the village sank into a heavier silence. His grandmother, Amma, heartbroken and desperate, pleaded with the village priest, “Find my boy… even if he’s beyond saving.”

The priest, an old man named Father D'Souza, had long avoided the tree. He knew things—tales passed down from his predecessor about blood sacrifices and an ancient curse buried deep beneath the roots.

But Amma's pain moved him.

That night, armed with sacred threads, holy water, and an old book of forgotten rites, he approached the tree.

As he neared, the whispers began—this time angrier, hungrier.

**“You dare challenge us?”**
**“The boy belongs to us now.”**
**“Leave… or join.”**

Father D'Souza stood his ground, chanting from the book. The air grew heavier, the bark of the tree twisted into faces—screaming, laughing, pleading.

Suddenly, from within the trunk, a hand reached out.

It was Ravi's.

But it wasn't human anymore.

His skin was bark. His fingers like twigs. His eyes glowed with a dim, root-like pulse.

“Amma…” he groaned, “I tried to run. But she won’t let me go.”

Behind him, a figure began to emerge—a woman, pale, dressed in funeral white, her feet floating just above the earth. Her eyes were black as pitch. The *bride beneath the tree.*

Centuries ago, she had been betrayed and buried alive by the very villagers she was to wed into. Wrongfully accused of witchcraft, she cursed them with her dying breath, binding her soul to the tree under which she was buried.

Every few decades, she claimed a soul—especially one that disrespected her resting place.

Father D'Souza held up the holy book, but the wind howled, tearing pages from it. The whispers screamed in chorus, and the tree cracked open like a wound.

But Amma appeared.

Holding Ravi’s childhood locket, she called out, not in fear—but in *forgiveness*.

“Let go of hate,” she whispered to the spirit. “Let him go.”

For the first time, the tree fell silent. The bride's ghost paused… something flickered in her eyes.

Tears.

The earth trembled. The roots recoiled. And with a final scream, the spirit faded.

Ravi collapsed at the base of the tree, unconscious—but breathing.

The bark that had twisted into faces slowly smoothed. The whispers ceased. The village, at last, slept in peace.

But the villagers never forgot.

They built a shrine where the tree once stood, honoring both the wronged soul and the courage of a grandmother’s love.

Yet some say… on moonless nights, if you press your ear to the ground—

You might still hear the faintest whisper:

**“We remember…”**

And so, *The Whispering Tree* became legend. But legends, like roots, run deep—twisting through time, waiting for someone new to listen.
